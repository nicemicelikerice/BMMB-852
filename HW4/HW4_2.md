# Part 2: Make use of ontologies

I chose mRNA as my feature type to explore.
In the bioinfo environment,

```bash
bio explain mrna
```

It gives the following description:

```bash
Messenger RNA is the intermediate molecule between DNA and protein. It includes UTR and coding sequences. It does not contain introns.
```

The parent nodes are:

```bash
Parents:
- mature_transcript
```

And the children nodes are:

```bash
Children:
- riboswitch (part_of)
- mrna_with_frameshift
- attenuator (part_of)
- est (derives_from)
- polya_sequence (adjacent_to)
- monocistronic_mrna
- polycistronic_mrna
- exemplar_mrna
- mrna_region (part_of)
- capped_mrna
- polyadenylated_mrna
- trans_spliced_mrna
- edited_mrna
- consensus_mrna
- nsd_transcript
- rna_thermometer (part_of)
- circular_mrna
- recoded_mrna
```

It appears that mRNA has a lot of different features within it, which I suppose is to be expected. As the mRNA must contain multiple different parts for regulation of gene expression.
